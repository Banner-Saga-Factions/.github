## :shield: Banner Saga Factions Community :shield:

This Organisation is a collection of repositories relating to the preservation of the game [Banner Saga Factions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219340/The_Banner_Saga_Factions/) by [Stoic Studio](https://stoicstudio.com/)

The game was taken off Steam in January 2021. The servers are still up but no new players can join. The primary goal at the minute is to replicate the [server side code](https://github.com/Banner-Saga-Factions/BSF-Custom-Server) to allow new players to pick up the game.
As well as server side code, there is also room for research into modifying the game client (there have been a few attempts at this so far with varied results) as well as documentation of the game and knowledge sharing to reduce the barrier of entry to new players once they have the ability to join.

Currently there is documentation in a few different places (maybe one day it might be consolidated):
1. The [README.md](https://github.com/Banner-Saga-Factions/BSF-Custom-Server/blob/main/README.md) in the Custom Server repo has some documentation of client launch args the help with development
2. The [docs](https://github.com/Banner-Saga-Factions/BSF-Custom-Server/tree/main/docs) of the Custom Server repo has a lot of notes on both client and server side data structures and the communication flow between them
3. The [BSF Research](https://github.com/eltaino1/BSF-Research) and [BSF Features](https://github.com/eltaino1/BSF-Features) repos by [@eltaino1](https://github.com/eltaino1) has WIP notes on building the client from source
4. The [code/win32/scripts](https://github.com/eltaino1/BSF-Research/tree/main/code/win32/scripts) directory in the BSF Research repo has the client source code (decompiled using [JPEXS](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler))
5. [This](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxvJJxdfj6VhHdRD9QtrQANQ7LWmIqcuWF) talk also provides some insight into the development process of factions and the server architecture
